## Question 1: Answer
Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm and technique where tasks and operations are executed independently and do not block the execution of subsequent code. In an asynchronous programming model, tasks can be initiated, and the program can continue executing other operations while waiting for the tasks to complete. This approach is particularly useful for handling time-consuming tasks, such as network requests, file operations, or user input.

In traditional synchronous programming, each operation is executed sequentially, one after the other, and the program waits for each operation to finish before proceeding to the next one. This can lead to inefficiencies and unresponsiveness, especially when dealing with tasks that require time to complete.

Asynchronous programming introduces mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and async/await in modern JavaScript, which allow developers to manage asynchronous tasks more efficiently. When an asynchronous operation is initiated, the program can continue executing other code without waiting for the operation to complete. Once the asynchronous operation is finished, a callback function or a promise handler is triggered to handle the result or error.

## Question 2: Answer
Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to another function, and they are used in asynchronous programming to handle the result of an asynchronous operation once it is completed. When an asynchronous task finishes executing, it calls the provided callback function to notify the caller about the result or completion status.

Here's a simple example of using a callback in JavaScript to perform an asynchronous operation:
```javascript
function fetchDataFromServer(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = { name: 'Yash', age: 22 };
    callback(data);
  }, 2000);
}
function processData(data) {
  console.log('Data received:', data);
}
fetchDataFromServer(processData);

console.log('Fetching data...');
```

## Question 3: Answer
A promise is an object in JavaScript that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It provides a more structured and convenient way to handle asynchronous tasks and avoid the callback hell.

Promises have three distinct states:

* Pending: The initial state when the promise is created, and the asynchronous operation is still in progress. It neither succeeded nor failed yet.

* Fulfilled (Resolved): The state when the asynchronous operation successfully completes, and the promise is ready with the resulting value.

* Rejected: The state when the asynchronous operation encounters an error or fails, and the promise is rejected with a reason (error) explaining the failure.

```javascript
// Function that returns a Promise to perform an asynchronous task
function fetchDataFromServer() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulating an asynchronous task with a delay of 2 seconds
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = { name: 'Yash', age: 22 };
      // Resolving the Promise with the fetched data
      resolve(data);
      // If an error occurs, reject the Promise with an error reason
      // reject("Error occurred during data fetching.");
    }, 2000);
  });
}

// Function to handle the resolved data
function handleSuccess(data) {
  console.log('Data received:', data);
}

// Function to handle any errors
function handleError(error) {
  console.error('Error:', error);
}

// Initiating the asynchronous operation and handling states
fetchDataFromServer()
  .then(handleSuccess) // This executes when the Promise is resolved (fulfilled).
  .catch(handleError); // This executes when the Promise is rejected.

console.log('Fetching data...'); // This will be printed first due to the asynchronous nature

```
## Question 4: Answer
```javascript
function delayResolve(value, delay) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(value);
    }, delay);
  });
}

const messagePromise = delayResolve("Hello Javascript", 5000);

messagePromise.then((message) => {
  console.log("Resolved value:", message);
  console.log("Length of the resolved string:", message.length);
});

```
```
Resolved value: Hello Javascript
Length of the resolved string: 16
```

## Question 5: Answer
Callback hell, also known as the "pyramid of doom" or "callback spaghetti," is a common problem in asynchronous programming, especially when dealing with multiple nested callbacks. It arises when multiple asynchronous operations are dependent on each other or when sequential operations are required. As a result, the code becomes deeply nested and challenging to read and maintain.

The callback hell problem occurs due to the nature of asynchronous operations. In traditional callback-based asynchronous code, one operation initiates another operation, and so on. This nesting of callbacks makes the code structure complicated, difficult to follow, and error-prone. 

Each nested callback represents an additional level of indentation, making the code harder to read and maintain as the number of asynchronous operations increases.

Promises, on the other hand, provide a solution to the callback hell problem by introducing a more structured and sequential approach to handle asynchronous tasks. Promises allow us to chain multiple asynchronous operations together in a more elegant and readable way, without nesting callbacks.

## Question 6: Answer
Both `Promise.all()` and `Promise.allSettled()` are methods in JavaScript that deal with multiple promises. However, they have different behaviors and outcomes:

1. `Promise.all()`:
- `Promise.all()` takes an array of promises as input and returns a single promise.
- It waits for all the promises in the input array to either resolve or reject.
- If all the promises resolve successfully, it returns an array of resolved values in the same order as the input promises.
- If any of the promises reject, the whole `Promise.all()` call is rejected, and it returns the rejection reason of the first promise that rejects.

2. `Promise.allSettled()`:
- `Promise.allSettled()` also takes an array of promises as input and returns a single promise.
- It waits for all the promises in the input array to settle (resolve or reject), regardless of their outcome.
- It returns an array of objects with a `status` property indicating whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected, and a `value` or `reason` property representing the resolved value or rejection reason, respectively.

Let's see an example to illustrate the differences:

```javascript
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve("Resolved 1"), 1000));
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject("Rejected 2"), 2000));
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve("Resolved 3"), 1500));

// Example using Promise.all()
Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then((results) => console.log("Promise.all - All resolved:", results))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Promise.all - Rejected:", error));

// Example using Promise.allSettled()
Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then((results) => console.log("Promise.allSettled - All settled:", results));
```

In this example, we have three promises (`promise1`, `promise2`, and `promise3`) that resolve or reject after different delays. Here's the output:

As you can see, with `Promise.all()`, the entire promise call is rejected as soon as the first promise (`promise2`) rejects, and the catch block is executed with the rejection reason of `promise2`.

On the other hand, `Promise.allSettled()` waits for all promises to either resolve or reject, and it returns an array with information about each promise's status and value/reason. In this case, it shows that `promise1` and `promise3` have been fulfilled, while `promise2` has been rejected.

## Question 7: Answer
```javascript
function checkAge(age) {
  if (age > 80) {
    throw new SyntaxError("You are too old.");
  }
}

// Example usage
try {
  checkAge(85);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message); // Output: "You are too old."
}

```

## Question 8: Answer
a. Output of the code:
```
Part 2 is resolved.
```

Explanation:
The `Promise.any()` method takes an array of promises as input and returns a new promise that is fulfilled when any of the input promises are fulfilled. It will be rejected only if all the input promises are rejected.

In the given code, `Promise.any()` is called with two promises. The first promise rejects after a delay of 2 seconds, and the second promise resolves after a delay of 5 seconds. Since `Promise.any()` fulfills when any of the promises fulfill, it will resolve as soon as the second promise resolves (Part 2). The rejection of the first promise (Part 1) does not affect the overall outcome.

b. Output of the code if Promise.any() is replaced by Promise.race():
```
Part 1 is rejected.
```

Explanation:
The `Promise.race()` method takes an array of promises as input and returns a new promise that is fulfilled or rejected as soon as any of the input promises are fulfilled or rejected.

In this case, if we replace `Promise.any()` with `Promise.race()`, the output will be determined by the first promise that settles, either fulfills or rejects. Since the first promise to settle is the one that rejects after 2 seconds (Part 1), the `Promise.race()` will immediately be rejected with the rejection reason of Part 1.

The output for this case is generated faster when using `Promise.race()` because it resolves or rejects as soon as any of the input promises settles, whereas `Promise.any()` waits for at least one promise to fulfill. In this scenario, the rejection of Part 1 happens before Part 2 is resolved, so the output is generated faster.

## Question 9: Answer
a. Output of the above code:
```
Part a
```

Justification:
In a Promise constructor, once the `resolve()` or `reject()` method is called, the Promise is considered settled, and only the first call to `resolve()` or `reject()` takes effect. Any subsequent calls to `resolve()` or `reject()` after the first one are ignored.

In the given code snippet, the Promise `p` is created with a `resolve()` call twice in a row. However, only the first `resolve()` call is effective, and the Promise will be resolved with the value "Part a". The second `resolve()` call is ignored, and "Part b" will not be considered as the resolved value for the Promise.

b. Code to get both resolved results:
To get both resolved results, you can use an array to store the resolved values and then use `Promise.all()` to wait for all the promises to resolve. Here's how you can modify the code:

```javascript
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve("Part a");
  // resolve("Part b"); // Remove this line to avoid settling the Promise immediately.
});

p.then((res) => {
  console.log(res); // Output: "Part a"
  return "Part b"; // Return the second value to chain another .then() handler.
})
.then((res) => {
  console.log(res); // Output: "Part b"
})
.catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

In this modified code, we remove the second `resolve("Part b")` line to avoid settling the Promise immediately. Instead, we use a single `then()` block to handle the first resolved value "Part a". We then return "Part b" in the first `then()` block to chain another `then()` handler. This way, we can handle the second resolved value "Part b" and print it to the console.

By chaining `then()` handlers, you can access multiple resolved values in the order they are resolved and perform further actions accordingly.
